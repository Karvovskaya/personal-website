Hi there :wave:  
My name is Neha. Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a [Research Data Manager](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/research-data-management) at Utrecht University Library. I support researchers with all aspects of their data management, keeping open science and [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) principles in mind.

I'm super enthusiastic about open science & open-source practices + projects + communities. Take a peek at my [Projects](https://nehamoopen.netlify.app/projects/) (still being updated) page to see what I've been up to --- at the university, and beyond :rocket:

I've a background in clinical psychology, and I've previously worked as a university teacher and junior researcher. During my researcher days, I was interested in using mHealth tools to better understand mental health symptoms in daily life.

If you're still curious, or want to trace my :india: -\> :united_arab_emirates: -\> :india: -\> :netherlands: journey --- you can check out a copy of my CV here (link coming soon).
